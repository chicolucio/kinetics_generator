# Kinetics generator

Generates chemical kinetics data.

![plot_example](saves/ex01_ln_conc.png)

Sometimes, as a chemistry teacher or professor, we want a data set so that
students can practice some concepts. This project generates chemical kinetics
data so that the educator can elaborate questions asking for the order and rate
constant for a given data set. The module can also simulates uncertainties
allowing the educator to explore error propagation and related subjects.


## Installation

Just clone or download this repo. This is not a package (yet, maybe someday :-))

## Usage

See the [tutorial file](kinetics_generator_tutorial.ipynb).

## Under the hood - requirements

This project relies mainly on [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/),
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and
[uncertainties](https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/).
